                I want you to process this text in two ways and return the output in JSON format with two keys: 
                'bullets' and 'explanation'. 

                1. **Bullets**: Extract the key terms from this text in a **simple bullet format**. 
                 - Only include the **most relevant** key terms, important concepts, and main points. 
                 - Do NOT explainâ€”just list the terms.

                2. **Explanation**: Take the same text and provide a **detailed** breakdown.
                 - Explain all the **main points**, important details, and core ideas from the text, I want you to touch on it each select part 
                - Use two to three small and larges **examples** to clarify meaning of each part also for easy understanding 
                 - Ensure the explanation is **easy enough for a 5-year-old**, but also **detailed enough for a very genus and gifted college student**.
                 - Always **expand on key ideas** instead of summarizing briefly.
                3. **Notes** : I want you to give expressive notes to try and take the most important concepts and points 
                  - Let it be be optimized , in a list , and still talk about each concepts 
                  - Check and make sure that is is clean and understanable 
                  - Work and try to thinkin the way a teache to try and set test and exams from thuis text when it comes to note taking , be like a harvard student who went to yale and MIT for post grdaduates 
        
                Return the result  **strictly** as a raw JSON without Markdown formatting "" like this :
                {{
                    "bullets": ["key term 1", "key term 2", "key term 3"],
